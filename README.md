# Zero downtime DB migrations demo

[slides are here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QbMRhIKYkv8wjIZZKdPFERU-FN8pObuRBsI0Vtz-Xls/edit?usp=sharing)

This is a self-service demo.

Each version tag contains a code for a subsequent release. Click through the tags to see how the code changes.

Each version should be deployed as follows:

- Migrations are applied on DB
- Code is reloaded after migrations succeed
